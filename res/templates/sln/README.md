# Templates
 This document details how to create your own template.

 ## Principles
  1. The name of the directory is the name of the template. (case-insensitive)
  2. Directories without a `raiden.template.jsonc` will be skipped.
  3. Only root directories are scanned for a `raiden.template.jsonc`, subdirectories will be skipped.

 ## Getting started
  Begin by creating a sub-directory inside this directory.

  *Well, todo.*
